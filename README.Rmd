`extractox` is a comprehensive R package designed to simplify querying various 
chemical, toxicological, and biological databases:

* the Integrated Chemical Environment (ICE) of the National Toxicology Program (NTP).
* the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) of the Environmental Protection 
  Agency (EPA).
* the Provisional Peer-Reviewed Toxicity Values (PPRTVs) of EPA.
* the Computational Toxicology Chemicals Dashboard Resource Hub (CompTox) of EPA,
* the monographs of International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World 
  Health Organization (WHO).
* PubChem of the National Center for Biotechnology Information/National Institutes
  Of Health (NCBI, NIH).
* the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTP) of the  MDI Biological Laboratory 
  and NC State University.

The package facilitates interaction with APIs, providing curated and user-friendly 
outputs.
To communicate with Pubchem, `extractox` relies on the package`webchem`.

## Installation

Install the package `extractox` from CRAN.

```r
# From CRAN
install.packages("extractox")
```
### Development Version

To get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version, you can 
install the development version of `extractox` from GitHub.

```r
# Install pak if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("pak", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("pak")
}

# Install the package from GitHub
pak::pkg_install("c1au6i0/extractox")
```

## Features

### NTP's ICE 

The ICE database provides access to a variety of data related to chemical toxicity,
exposure, and risk assessment. It includes data from high-throughput screening 
assays, in vivo studies, and computational models.

`extr_ice` provides access to NTP’s ICE database for toxicological and 
exposure-related data.


```{r}
library(extractox)
# assays is null so all assays are retrieved
ice_data <- extr_ice(casrn = c("50-00-0"), assays = NULL, verbose = FALSE)
names(ice_data)
```

There are more than **2000 possible assays** in ICE. The `extr_ice_assay_names()` 
function allows to search for assay names that match a pattern you're interested in. 
Please note that searches are case sensitive and accept regexp.

```{r}
extr_ice_assay_names("Rat Acute", verbose = FALSE) # keep empty to retrieve all
```


### EPA's IRIS

The IRIS database contains information on the health effects of exposure to various 
substances found in the environment. It provides qualitative and quantitative health 
risk information.

`extr_iris` provides access to EPA’s IRIS database and accepts queries CASRN or 
IUPAC names of chemicals.

```{r}
iris_info <- extr_iris(c("glyphosate", "50-00-0"), verbose = FALSE)
names(iris_info)
```


### EPA's PPRTVs

The `extr_pprtv` function allows you to extract data for specified identifiers 
(CASRN or chemical names) from the EPA's PPRTVs database. This function retrieves 
the file containing all the chemicals and processes it, but if has an argument 
(`force`) to allow users to use a cached file or force a fresh download.

```{r}
# Example usage to extract data for a specific CASRN
dat_pprtv_1 <- extr_pprtv(ids = "107-02-8", search_type = "casrn", verbose = FALSE)

# Example usage to extract data for a chemical name
dat_pprtv_2 <- extr_pprtv(ids = "Acrolein", search_type = "name", verbose = FALSE)
```


### EPA's CompTox

The CompTox Chemistry Dashboard provides access to data on chemical structures, 
properties, and associated bioactivity data. It integratesdata from various sources 
to support chemical safety assessments.

`extr_comptox` extracts data from CompTox using either CASRN or IUPAC names of 
chemicals and returns a **list of dataframes**.

```{r}
info_comptox <- extr_comptox(ids = c("Aspirin", "50-00-0"), verbose = FALSE)
names(info_comptox)
```


### WHO's IARC

The IARC Monographs database contains evaluations of the carcinogenic risks of various 
substances to humans. It provides detailed  information about Monographs, including 
publication volumes and years, evaluation years, and additional relevant details.

The function `extr_monograph` provides access to the WHO IARC Monographs database 
and accepts queries using CASRN or the names of chemicals.

```{r}
dat <- extr_monograph(
  search_type = "casrn",
  ids = c("105-74-8", "120-58-1"),
  verbose = FALSE
)
str(dat)

# Example usage for name search
dat2 <- extr_monograph(
  search_type = "name",
  ids = c("Aloe", "Schistosoma", "Styrene")
)
```


### NIH's PubChem

PubChem provides information on chemical structures, identifiers, chemical and 
physical properties, biological activities, safety and toxicity information, 
patents, literature citations, and more.

A series of functions that rely on the `webchem` package are used to extract 
chemical information, Globally Harmonized System (`GHS`) classification data, or 
flavor classification (`FEMA`) from PubChem.

The function `extr_chem_info` retrieves chemical information of IUPAC-named 
chemicals. A warning is displayed if the chemical is not found.

```{r}
chem_info <- extr_chem_info(
  iupac_names = c("Formaldehyde", "Aflatoxin B1"),
  verbose = FALSE
)
names(chem_info)
```


Two functions are used to extract specific sections of PubChem chemical information using CASRN:

- `extr_pubchem_ghs` extracts GHS codes.
- `extr_pubchem_fema` extracts FEMA data.


```{r}
ghs_info <- extr_pubchem_ghs(casrn = c("50-00-0", "64-17-5"), verbose = FALSE)
fema_info <- extr_pubchem_fema(casrn = c("50-00-0", "123-68-2"), verbose = FALSE)
```


### MDI's CTD

The CTP provides information about the interactions between chemicals, genes, 
and diseases. It helps in understanding the effects of environmental exposures 
on human health.

A series of functions interact with the CTP database.

`extr_ctd` extracts information related to chemical-gene or pathway associations.

```{r}
input_terms <- c("50-00-0", "64-17-5", "methanal", "ethanol")
ctd_association <- extr_ctd(
  input_terms = input_terms,
  category = "chem",
  report_type = "genes_curated",
  input_term_search_type = "directAssociations",
  action_types = "ANY",
  ontology = c("go_bp", "go_cc"),
  verbose = FALSE
)

names(ctd_association)

# Get expresssion data
ctd_expression <- extr_ctd(
  input_terms = input_terms,
  report_type = "cgixns",
  category = "chem",
  action_types = "expression",
  verbose = FALSE
)

names(ctd_expression)
```


Tetramers are computationally generated information units that interrelate four
data types from the CTP: a chemical, gene product, phenotype, and disease. They
help in understanding the complex relationships between these entities and their 
combined impact on human health.

`extr_tetramer` extracts info related to tetramers from CTD.

```{r echo=FALSE}
Sys.sleep(3)
```

```{r}
tetramer_data <- extr_tetramer(
  chem = c("50-00-0", "ethanol"),
  disease = "",
  gene = "",
  go = "",
  input_term_search_type = "directAssociations",
  qt_match_type = "equals",
  verbose = FALSE
)

names(tetramer_data)
```


## Important Note regarding OpenSSL


Please note that functions that pull data from EPA servers may encounter
issues on systems. This is because these servers do not
accept secure legacy renegotiation. On Linux system, those functions
depend on `curl` and `OpenSSL`, which have known problems with unsafe
legacy renegotiation in newer versions. By using
 [`condathis`](https://github.com/luciorq/condathis), the current package 
 installs a specific `OpenSSL` version in an isolated environment in
 order to comunicate with the EPA servers.
